        'content': """We're already a full four weeks into the season. Seriously, where does the time go? This weekend, there are a couple of big games lined up: No. 12 Notre Dame is playing No. 18 Wisconsin in Solider Field in Chicago which is surely going to be an interesting one. Then No. 7 Texas A&amp;M and No. 16 Arkansas are playing in AT&amp;T Stadium in Dallas. While these are the only games between ranked opponents, we'll be all in on whatever else transpires this last weekend of September. Check out all the results, reaction and revelry from throughout the land. No matter what your feelings were about Notre Dame at the beginning of the season -- College Football Playoff contention? Rebuild year? -- one thing was certain: The middle of the schedule was going to be rough. With perhaps three tighter-than-expected wins in the book, the Irish will now play Wisconsin in Chicago, Virginia Tech in Blacksburg and Cincinnati, USC and North Carolina at home between now and Halloween. Four of those teams rank 17th or better in SP+, and the one that doesn't (Virginia Tech) has already beaten one of those four other teams and rushes the passer brilliantly. Notre Dame can, of course, win each of these five games. But the Irish are slight underdogs to Wisconsin on Saturday, and SP+, which correctly predicted some of their early struggles, quantifies the four games after Wisconsin as almost exactly 50-50 toss-ups. It gives the Irish about a 3% chance of winning all five ... and a 3% chance of losing all five. Read more from Bill Connelly's Week 4 preview (ESPN+). Full schedule: All teams | Top 25 NIL deal of the week Cade York is now "queso rich," and it's giving us all the "chocolate wasted" feels. Time to celebrate The City of Fresno has declared this week "Fresno State Football and Quarterback Jake Haener Week."

Yeah, evidently Jaxson Dart has drawn inspiration from Star Wars in case you were wondering what the deal was with his eye black. Dart, however, is out indefinitely after having surgery to repair a meniscus injury. Stephen A. Smith is a man of his words. He lost a bet to Tim Tebow -- he said Florida would lose by more than three touchdowns to Alabama last weekend, and he had to pay up. play 0:49 Stephen A. Smith shows up to First Take sporting a Florida Gators tie after losing a bet to Tim Tebow. And it's safe to say that the Gators loved this look on him. There are lots of callbacks to movies this week, and Oregon is on trend with its Dark Knight threads.

        'title': "LSU vs. Mississippi State: Prediction, pick, football game spread, odds, live stream, watch online, TV channel",
        'content': """Almost exactly a full year to the day after Mississippi State stunned LSU, then the defending national champion, on the road, these two teams are set to meet again Saturday in Starkville, Mississippi. This time around, however, the Tigers already have a loss on their ledger and hope a revenge game vs. the Bulldogs can be a springboard back to national relevance. Check out LIVE updates from the top games in Week 4   Mississippi State will try to bounce back from a crushing -- and controversial -- 31-29 loss at Memphis last week. Mike Leach's team led 17-7 at halftime and nearly doubled Memphis in total yards, but a 94-yard punt return by the Tigers that featured two errors by the officiating crew helped seal Mississippi State's fate. Just two weeks ago, though, the Bulldogs rode the momentum generated by a raucous home crowd at Davis-Wade Stadium to a quality 24-10 win over NC State in a night game. With a noon ET kickoff this time, Mississippi State needs its fans to be revved up by the presence of an SEC West rival to recreate that home-field advantage. LSU lost its first road game at UCLA in Week 1, but sophomore quarterback Max Johnson has turned in a pair of quality performances since then and looks ready for another test away from Tiger Stadium. LSU vs. Mississippi State: Need to know A rock fight in the trenches: Don't expect much production on the ground from either side. Neither team has been able to run the ball effectively, but their respective run defenses have been excellent. The Tigers average right around 3 yards per rush, ranking 120th nationally. (For comparison's sake, LSU's 2019 national title team averaged 4.28 yards per carry.) Similarly, Mississippi State's 2.72 yards per rush ranks 125th nationally. However, LSU and Mississippi State have top-25 run defenses at 2.66 and 2.93 yards per carry allowed, respectively. To put it simply, both teams have work to do on the ground. Defensive chess: Playing man coverage against Mississippi State last season spelled doom for LSU as Leach introduced himself to the SEC with a bang. Former Bulldogs' quarterback K.J. Costello threw for 623 yards, an SEC-record in the 44-34 victory, which exposed the cracks in defensive coordinator Bo Pelini's system. Pelini is out and Daronte Jones is in as DC, but the Tigers are still playing a lot of man coverage. Only 10 teams in the nation play man-to-man more frequently, according to TruMedia data. The Tigers are loaded with talent in their secondary, but they would be wise to drop eight men into zone coverage and force the Bulldogs to try and run the ball. Star receivers on both sides: With both teams relying so heavily on the pass, it's no surprise that there are budding stars at receiver. LSU sophomore Kayshon Boutte leads the SEC with six receiving touchdowns. He's also tied for third with 20 receptions and ranks sixth with 223 yards receiving. Mississippi State's Makiai Polk is leads the league with 25 receptions and ranks fifth with 226 yards. Shutting these players down, or at least limiting their number of explosive plays, could make the difference.

        'title': "Fantasy Football Week 3 prep: PPR league cheat sheet to help you get the most out of your lineups",
        'content': """The Lineup Cheat Sheet combines Fantasy analysis and game-flow predictions with a confidence scale to give you a definitive answer on who to start in your leagues. It's pretty simple: The scale runs from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident you should be to start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for Week 2 is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him. To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're still unsure, just send a note on Twitter (@daverichard) and I'll give it a look, time permitting. Ready to get off on the right foot?

The line wants us to believe: Carolina's just not quite good enough to score another blowout. My guess is the oddsmakers aren't convinced the Panthers can match their implied point total of 25.5 and think they'll win by one score or less. But rookie Davis Mills will have just a few precious days of practice before making his first NFL start against a defense that has a league-high 10 sacks. I'm not convinced the Texans will score more than 14, and I am convinced the Panthers can get more than 22. Panthers RTG (MAX 10) Texans RTG (MAX 10) Sam Darnold (6.1) Davis Mills (3.2) Christian McCaffrey (10.0) David Johnson (3.0) D.J. Moore (7.4) Brandin Cooks (6.2) Robby Anderson (5.7) Texans DST (3.3) Terrace Marshall Jr. (3.2) Panthers DST (8.6) The line wants us to believe: Atlanta's hopeless. The Falcons were within three points on the road at Tampa Bay last week when Matt Ryan threw two pick-sixes. That was good to see, but the reality is that the Falcons defense is just too weak. It has allowed 32-plus points in consecutive games and is now set to battle a rested Giants offense that should load up Saquon Barkley with plenty of touches. It's the scariest sentence I'll type today: The Giants should find a way to win. Falcons RTG (MAX 10) Giants RTG (MAX 10) Matt Ryan (6.5) Daniel Jones (6.9) Mike Davis (6.5) Saquon Barkley (8.4) Calvin Ridley (8.9) Sterling Shepard (7.8) Cordarrelle Patterson (4.9) Kenny Golladay (6.6) Kyle Pitts (7.6) Evan Engram (6.7) Falcons DST (3.1) Giants DST (6.3) The line wants us to believe: Jacksonville is competitive. The Jaguars have lost both games by at least 10 points -- why expect anything different now? Apparently, the oddsmakers think differently as they're begging you to take the Cardinals. Maybe they think this is a trap game for Arizona since they play the Rams in Week 4. Maybe they're laying the biggest trap of the season for bettors, but the fact is there are no compelling reasons to believe Jacksonville is close to being a good team on either side of the ball. Cardinals RTG (MAX 10) Jaguars RTG (MAX 10) Kyler Murray (9.7) Trevor Lawrence (6.2) Chase Edmonds (7.5) James Robinson (6.4) James Conner (5.6) Marvin Jones (6.3) DeAndre Hopkins (9.5) D.J. Chark (5.4) Rondale Moore (6.1) Laviska Shenault Jr. (4.5) Christian Kirk (4.7) Jaguars DST (1.2) A.J. Green (4.6) Cardinals DST (8.0) The line wants us to believe: L.A.'s mistake-filled ways will continue. Untimely drops by their top three receivers and really lame penalties have robbed them of at least four touchdowns this season. This is a good week to get their act together against a Chiefs squad Justin Herbert nearly beat in his first NFL game. Now he has better coaching, plus the Chiefs haven't looked like a team that could blow out anybody thus far. Expect the Bolts to keep it tight.  Chargers RTG (MAX 10) Chiefs RTG (MAX 10) Justin Herbert (8.1) Patrick Mahomes (9.4) Austin Ekeler (9.7) Clyde Edwards-Helaire (6.1) Keenan Allen (9.0) Darrel Williams (5.7) Mike Williams (7.55) Tyreek Hill (9.6) Jared Cook (6.2) Mecole Hardman (4.4) Chargers DST (4.3) Demarcus Robinson (2.2) Travis Kelce (9.6) Chiefs DST (4.5) The line wants us to believe: The Lions are a bad team. The reality is that the Ravens have played two close, competitive games where fumbles basically determined the winner. The oddsmakers seemingly knew they could get away with bloating the line because people would take the Ravens no matter what. Detroit has made plenty of mistakes but it has not played scared and has fought hard in every game. This is a spot for them to keep up with the Ravens. Ravens RTG (MAX 10) Lions RTG (MAX 10) Lamar Jackson (9.0) Jared Goff (6.0) Ty'Son Williams (8.0) D'Andre Swift (7.8) Latavius Murray (4.7) Jamaal Williams (5.9) Marquise Brown (7.0) Quintez Cephus (4.65) Sammy Watkins (3.9) T.J. Hockenson (8.4) Mark Andrews (7.0) Lions DST (2.0) Ravens DST (7.6) The line wants us to believe: Even with their injuries, the Steelers are a better team. Expect a wake-up call for the Steelers here -- the Bengals have played hard through most of their first two games and are catching Pittsburgh with a depleted front seven and an ailing Ben Roethlisberger playing behind a bad offensive line. Cincinnati's front was able to pressure the Bears a decent amount last week (three sacks). Don't be shocked if the Bengals find a way to win outright. Bengals RTG (MAX 10) Steelers RTG (MAX 10) Joe Burrow (6.15) Ben Roethlisberger (5.4) Joe Mixon (8.6) Najee Harris (7.7) Ja'Marr Chase (7.5) JuJu Smith-Schuster (6.5) Tee Higgins (0.0) Chase Claypool (6.7) Tyler Boyd (6.4) Pat Freiermuth (3.2) Bengals DST (6.1) Steelers DST (6.0) The line wants us to believe: Chicago isn't as good as last week suggests. The Bears nearly blew a 17-point lead with under 7 minutes to play last week, but they also had a pair of dropped touchdowns including an improbable one from Allen Robinson. Chicago's actually a more dangerous team with Justin Fields under center since he will challenge downfield more than Andy Dalton. In the 20 games Kevin Stefanski has coached, the Browns have won by seven-plus points just six times. Cleveland should win, but the Bears should keep it close. Bears RTG (MAX 10) Browns RTG (MAX 10) Justin Fields (6.8) Baker Mayfield (5.8) David Montgomery (8.8) Nick Chubb (9.0) Allen Robinson (7.65) Kareem Hunt (7.4) Darnell Mooney (6.25) Odell Beckham (5.5) Cole Kmet (5.0) Rashard Higgins (3.8) Bears DST (5.3) Donovan Peoples-Jones (2.1) Austin Hooper (5.6) Browns DST (6.8) The line wants us to believe: Even with a beat-up Carson Wentz, the Colts aren't a pushover. Indy has to hit the exacta of protecting Wentz and stopping Derrick Henry all game long. The former will be easier to do than the latter -- Tennessee is league-average in sacks and has the sixth-lowest pressure rate at 14.1%. But Henry's put up over 100 yards in three straight against the Colts, two of which were convincing Tennessee wins. The oddsmakers may have devised a terrific trap here, but the hunch is the Titans will pull away late. Colts RTG (MAX 10) Titans RTG (MAX 10) Carson Wentz (4.65) Ryan Tannehill (6.6) Jonathan Taylor (8.9) Derrick Henry (9.8) Nyheim Hines (5.8) A.J. Brown (8.5) Michael Pittman (6.0) Julio Jones (6.9) Zach Pascal (4.3) Titans DST (4.9) Jack Doyle (5.3) Colts DST (4.1) The line wants us to believe: Bill Belichick's defense will overwhelm Jameis Winston. Honestly, that's not too hard to believe. What might be harder to believe is that Sean Payton's offense won't find clever ways to keep this game close. Both teams sport quality defenses, but it's the Saints that might get tested more so than the Pats, who figure to try controlling the clock in an effort to win. This will also be the Saints' third straight game away from New Orleans. Saints RTG (MAX 10) Patriots RTG (MAX 10) Jameis Winston (4.4) Mac Jones (4.7) Alvin Kamara (9.5) James White (7.3) Marquez Callaway (2.4) Damien Harris (7.2) Juwan Johnson (2.8) Jakobi Meyers (4.2) Saints DST (6.4) Nelson Agholor (3.4) Jonnu Smith (5.9) Hunter Henry (3.4) Patriots DST (7.0) The line wants us to believe: Buffalo is a dominant NFL team. The Bills might get there, but they're not there yet. Washington was gifted a win last week, and while they haven't shown enough to make anyone believe they could win at Buffalo, they also haven't shown anything to suggest they could be blown out. They've played two close games against two mistake-prone teams. Josh Allen has been a mistake-prone passer through two weeks and will be challenged here. This seems too easy to take Washington, but my guess is the public will be all over Buffalo.  Washington RTG (MAX 10) Bills RTG (MAX 10) Taylor Heinicke (5.6) Josh Allen (8.2) Antonio Gibson (7.9) Devin Singletary (6.3) J.D. McKissic (6.2) Zack Moss (4.0) Terry McLaurin (7.9) Stefon Diggs (9.1) Adam Humphries (2.8) Cole Beasley (5.0) Dyami Brown (1.7) Emmanuel Sanders (3.0) Logan Thomas (6.8) Gabriel Davis (2.5) Washington DST (5.7) Bills DST (7.3) The line wants us to believe: The Raiders aren't as good as their record says. It's interesting that Vegas won by six against Baltimore and nine against Pittsburgh but are only getting 3.5 here. But under the surface of a 2-0 Raiders team is a squad with a depleted O-line, a still-not-good defense, a suspect run game and, most importantly, a hurt quarterback. It absolutely feels like the oddsmakers want you to take them, so don't. The Dolphins defense should find a way to keep the game close if not win outright. Dolphins RTG (MAX 10) Raiders RTG (MAX 10) Jacoby Brissett (3.3) Derek Carr (7.0) Myles Gaskin (7.6) Kenyan Drake (6.6) Jaylen Waddle (5.6) Henry Ruggs III (5.9) Will Fuller (4.0) Hunter Renfrow (3.5) DeVante Parker (3.7) Bryan Edwards (3.1) Mike Gesicki (4.0) Darren Waller (8.6) Dolphins DST (3.7) Raiders DST (6.9) The line wants us to believe: The Broncos are capable of a third straight blowout win. The oddsmakers knew they'd have to give the Jets a lot of points -- I'm surprised it's only 10.5. They might have gotten away with more because no one really wants to take the Jets even with a bunch of points. The only concern is that the Broncos will do what it takes to win and not necessarily annihilate an opponent, and Zach Wilson has shown some positives through two weeks. I'd still chance it with Denver. Jets RTG (MAX 10) Broncos RTG (MAX 10) Zach Wilson (3.0) Teddy Bridgewater (6.3) Michael Carter (5.0) Melvin Gordon (7.0) Corey Davis (5.2) Javonte Williams (6.9) Braxton Berrios (4.1) Courtland Sutton (7.6) Elijah Moore (2.3) Tim Patrick (5.3) Jets DST (2.4) K.J. Hamler (3.3) Noah Fant (7.4) Broncos DST (10.0) The line wants us to believe: This will be a close, fun, high-scoring game. The Rams haven't been tested by a prolific offense yet, and the Bucs haven't taken on a challenging defense yet. It will be fascinating to see how the Rams try to get after Tom Brady -- I wonder if they'll try to blitz him like the Saints did last year. Going against Brady has always been a dangerous endeavor but the Rams should have enough on both sides of the ball to take him down. Buccaneers RTG (MAX 10) Rams RTG (MAX 10) Tom Brady (8.4) Matthew Stafford (8.5) Leonard Fournette (6.8) Sony Michel (5.1) Chris Godwin (8.2) Cooper Kupp (9.4) Mike Evans (7.7) Robert Woods (8.1) Rob Gronkowski (7.8) Van Jefferson (2.6) Buccaneers DST (5.9) DeSean Jackson (1.6) Tyler Higbee (6.4) Rams DST (6.7) The line wants us to believe: The Packers' win over the Lions means nothing. This is an absolute trap line -- why else would the oddsmakers give you points with Aaron Rodgers?! The Packers deserve credit for bouncing back against Detroit, but their defense still has some holes in it and the 49ers have proven to be cagey through two games. Stick with the home team. Packers RTG (MAX 10) 49ers RTG (MAX 10) Aaron Rodgers (8.8) Jimmy Garoppolo (6.4) Aaron Jones (9.6) Trey Sermon (6.7) A.J. Dillon (2.9) Trenton Cannon (3.1) Davante Adams (9.7) Deebo Samuel (6.8) Marquez Valdes-Scantling (2.0) Brandon Aiyuk (2.9) Robert Tonyan (6.0) George Kittle (7.5) Packers DST (5.5) 49ers DST (5.1) The line wants us to believe: The Vikings really are an explosive offense. Kirk Cousins has looked sharp through two weeks but the Vikings were stuck at 24 points in an overtime loss in Week 1 and only topped 30 points last week thanks to a pick-six. Their implied total of 26.75 points seems a tad too high. Can't say the same of Seattle, who has posted at least 28 points in each game so far. Seahawks RTG (MAX 10) Vikings RTG (MAX 10) Russell Wilson (9.5) Kirk Cousins (7.6) Chris Carson (8.5) Dalvin Cook (9.9) Tyler Lockett (9.3) Justin Jefferson (9.2) DK Metcalf (8.6) Adam Thielen (8.7) Freddie Swain (2.7) K.J. Osborn (5.8) Gerald Everett (3.0) Tyler Conklin (3.6) Seahawks DST (4.7) Vikings DST (3.5) The line wants us to believe: What happened to these teams in Week 1 were illusions. It really feels like the oddsmakers are counting on the public to take Dallas on the strength of their Week 2 win, which was pretty fortunate given the Chargers' mistakes. Philadelphia is a better squad than what they showed against the 49ers, but the loss of pass rusher Brandon Graham on defense is going to hurt all year. If the Cowboys stick with their run game, they'll cover this spread.  Eagles RTG (MAX 10) Cowboys RTG (MAX 10) Jalen Hurts (8.6) Dak Prescott (8.7) Miles Sanders (7.1) Ezekiel Elliott (8.2) Kenneth Gainwell (5.5) Tony Pollard (6.0) DeVonta Smith (7.1) CeeDee Lamb (8.4) Jalen Reagor (4.8) Amari Cooper (8.0) Quez Watkins (3.6) Ced Wilson (1.8) Dallas Goedert (6.6) Blake Jarwin (3.8) Eagles DST (3.9) Dalton Schultz (2.6) Cowboys DST (2.9) So who should you start and sit this week?

        'title': "How to buy a computer: Everything to consider",
        'content': """© Provided by BGR How to Buy A Computer A great computer can completely change your productivity. A computer that’s right for your needs will perform tasks quickly without taking too much time to load, while also offering a comfortable typing experience and a form-factor that fits your lifestyle. Of course, there are hundreds of computer models out there, and they’re not all created equal. As such, it’s important to consider all aspects of a computer before you buy, so that you know you’re getting one that meets your needs. But even doing that research can take hours. More Amazon Deals from BGR We’ve done the work so that you don’t have to. Here’s everything you should consider before buying a computer. Processor Think about your computer’s processor like its brain. The processor, or CPU, is basically the main chip inside of a computer that tells all the other components what to do, and when. Processor speeds are measured in GHz, or gigahertz. The faster the speed, the less time it takes for a processor to perform a task. Most modern processors also have multiple cores, which means that they can handle multiple tasks simultaneously. The most common processor companies for computers these days are Intel and AMD. That said, Apple has started building its own processors, and Qualcomm is supplying processors for some Windows computers. Usually, desktop computers can offer more powerful processors than laptops. That’s because desktop computers can supply more power without needing to worry about battery life. RAM Random Access Memory, or RAM, heavily impacts how many things your computer can be doing at a time. When you open a file or app, it’s loaded into the computer’s RAM, until you close it or no longer need it. When you consider the fact that you might have multiple or many apps and files open at a time, it becomes clear why more RAM is better. Most people who just want to browse the web, check email, and perform basic tasks, can probably get away with 8GB of RAM, though upgrading to 16GB can’t hurt if it’s within budget. Those with more demanding workloads should consider a computer with 32GB of RAM if possible. Storage While a computer’s RAM is essentially its short-term memory, storage is its long-term memory. The more storage you have, the more files and apps you can store on your computer. This may not matter for those who stream their music and videos, and rely on cloud storage for their files. But if you like to keep files saved locally on your actual computer, or game at all, then more storage is better. The most basic computers commonly have 128GB of storage. If you do like to keep files on your actual computer, we recommend upgrading to at least 256GB or more. There are also different kinds of storage. Most modern computers use solid-state storage, which is faster and more reliable than a traditional spinning-disk hard drive. Graphics A GPU, or graphics processing unit, basically handles everything that you see on your screen. Most processors actually have a GPU built onto the chip, and those integrated GPUs are generally more than powerful enough to handle displaying basic things like web pages and videos. But as soon as you start doing things like heavier gaming, graphic design, and video editing, you might want to think about a dedicated GPU in your computer. Higher-end GPUs come from the likes of NVIDIA and AMD, and they’ve both been pushing the boundaries of graphics performance of what you can get from a computer’s graphics. Generally, the graphics in a laptop aren’t quite as powerful as those in a desktop computer. Desktop computers have more room for a larger graphics card that offers better cooling and more power. That said, laptops can still offer more than enough graphics performance for most. Ports Depending on the kinds of accessories and peripherals you want to use with your computer, you’ll need to think about ports. Here’s a quick rundown of some of the most popular ports. Ethernet: Allows your computer to connect to the internet through a wired connection. USB-A: The classic, rectangular USB connector. USB-A ports can use different USB standards, with different speeds. These range from USB 1.0 to USB 4, however usually USB 4 ports use the USB-C connector standard. USB-C: A different connector for the USB standard. Often, Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4 ports use the USB-C connector standard, too. 3.5mm Headphone Jack: A small circular connector that you use to listen to audio, usually with headphones. HDMI: A video connector that can carry a video signal to a display. There are a few different HDMI standards, and sometimes, HDMI uses a smaller port called Mini HDMI. DisplayPort: A slightly less common video connector that supports screens of up to 16K, with the latest standard. SD card slot: A slot for the SD card, commonly used in cameras. Allows you to quickly and easily transfer files between devices. MicroSD card slot: A slot for the smaller MicroSD card, commonly used in phones, some cameras, and so on. Size and weight If you’re buying a desktop computer that will mostly live on or under a desk, the overall size and weight of your computer may not matter all that much. But if you want a laptop, you’ll need to make sure that you get something that’s small enough to suit your lifestyle. Of course, there are some trade-offs to consider. Generally speaking, the thinner and lighter the laptop, the harder it is for the device to manage heat generated by the processor and GPU. But companies like Apple have been seriously innovating on that front, and you can still get a pretty powerful laptop that’s light and thin. Most gaming laptops are still pretty thick though. Display If you’re buying a laptop, you’ll want to consider the display on the device. There are a few metrics to consider for the display. For starters, you’ll want to think about display type. Most laptops have LED displays, which can get pretty bright. Some newer laptops, however, have switched to OLED, which offers deeper black levels and higher contrast. Read more about display types here. Then there’s display resolution. Higher resolution displays look crisper, but they also usually take more battery. You’ll have to decide what resolution you want. Those that want the cutting edge may want a 4K laptop display, however, most users will be perfectly happy with a 1,080p display. Last but not least is the refresh rate. Most laptop displays refresh at 60Hz, however, in recent years, laptops have been upgrading to 120Hz+ panels. This will make for smoother animations and a generally more responsive feel, however again, it does impact battery life. Keyboard The keyboard is a very important part of how you interact with your computer. Unfortunately, of course, it can be hard to judge how a laptop’s keyboard will be before you see the laptop in person. That’s where we recommend either trying to find a store that you can try the keyboard out, or reading reviews. Ultimately, you can always use an external keyboard, even if you get a laptop. That said, if you do get a laptop, you’re probably getting it to use on the go. Carrying around a keyboard, in that case, isn’t very practical. Battery If you’re buying a laptop to use on the road, you’ll need something that can last. In recent years, Apple’s M1 MacBook Air and MacBook Pro have offered incredible battery lives, thanks to Apple’s switch to ARM. Unfortunately, looking at the basic size of the battery isn’t really enough to know how long the device will last. Things like the processor, display, and more, heavily impact battery life. So, two laptops with different processors and displays but the same battery size, could have radically different battery life. This is another area where we recommend looking at reviews. Generally, manufacturers also list battery life in hours, though the way they measure that changes from company to company.

        'title': "Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio hands-on: one weird, powerful computer",
        'content': """Alongside the new Surface Pro 8, Microsoft is introducing an all-new computer: the Surface Laptop Studio. It’s the successor to the Surface Book 3, but instead of featuring a detachable screen, it has one that flips into tablet mode. Where other 2-in-1s usually just go for a 360-degree hinge that flips the screen to the back, Microsoft’s system has it settling in on top of the keyboard. The Laptop Studio starts at $1,599.99, which is a premium price for what Microsoft is clearly positioning as a premium device. While it looks just like a MacBook when it’s in laptop mode, that comparison is mostly down to it being a very well-made device with a silver, aluminum body. Once you start moving the screen, it becomes another kind of device entirely. It’s a clever design that Microsoft has implemented somewhat more elegantly than we’ve seen on other laptops. Only somewhat, though: unlike the desktop Surface Studio that inspired it, the Laptop Studio can’t hold its screen up at any angle when it’s out of laptop mode. It can’t float out over the keyboard. You can only set it into three modes: laptop, flat as a tablet, or up in a kind of tent mode, leaving the trackpad visible. There are magnets in the laptop that help guide the screen into place. Folding the Surface Laptop Studio into tablet mode. GIF: Vjeran Pavic None of that is especially weird, nor is Microsoft’s positioning of the Surface Laptop Studio somewhere in between major powerhouse gaming laptops and thin-and-lights. I’ll get into specs below, but they’re in line with what you’d expect the successor to the Surface Book 3 to have. What’s weird is the plinth. Perhaps “pedestal” is a better word. See, if you look at the Laptop Studio from above, it looks for all the world like a MacBook, right on down to the oversized trackpad that uses haptics instead of physical clicks to register your clicks. (One difference, I suppose, is that Microsoft made a good keyboard on the first try with the Laptop Studio.) But sitting underneath the standard-looking laptop part is a rectangular base that is narrower than the laptop itself. It is part of how the Laptop Studio kicks out heat, out of the sides of that plinth. It means that from the angle you usually see it, the laptop looks thinner than it actually is and like it’s floating a half inch or so above the table. One thing the inset plinth does is make space to store the new Surface Slim Pen 2. It can magnetically click in under the trackpad portion and charge there. The $129.99 Pen has a more tapered, sharper tip and also has some haptics. When you begin drawing on the screen, the pen attempts to mimic the drag you’d feel on paper. In my very short time with it, it didn’t feel very realistic, just a little vibration at the start of the pen stroke. However, there’s time for developers to update their apps with better support. The screen is very nice. It’s a 14.4-inch touchscreen in a 3:2 aspect ratio — 2400 x 1600 pixels (201 PPI). It can reach a 120Hz refresh rate and of course works with Surface Pens. Bezels around it are on the small side, and there’s a Windows Hello camera for logging in at the top — and Microsoft says it’s better at recognizing faces so they’re lit properly for videoconferencing. There are four speakers in the body of the laptop with support for Dolby Atmos. I heard them get quite loud with very nice stereo separation but not a ton of bass. Maybe more important to creatives is that Microsoft has finally begun supporting Thunderbolt on its Surface devices this year. The Surface Laptop Studio has two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports opposite the Surface connector and headphone jack. Sadly, there is no SD card slot. The Laptop Studio can have either an 11th Gen Core i5 or Core i7 processor (specifically, the 35-watt i5-11300H or i7-11370H) and can either feature integrated Xe graphics or an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti laptop GPU with 4GB of GDDR6 RAM. You can get 16 or 32GB of LDDR4x RAM and storage ranges from 256GB to 2TB. (Enterprise customers can spec an NVIDIA RTX A2000 laptop GPU with 4GB GDDR6 GPU RAM.) Those specs are another indication that this computer is part of the Surface Book’s lineage, aimed more at creators than gamers. Microsoft has put a lot of power in here, but directed at coders and creatives. We’ll review the Surface Laptop Studio as soon as we can with an eye toward whether it makes sense for that kind of user — and also to see if we can get used to the plinth. Sometimes polarizing designs end up feeling iconic and sometimes they just end up looking weird. If nothing else, Microsoft deserves credit for taking that risk in the first place."""

        'title': "Apple reportedly told a TV and movie workers’ union its TV Plus had fewer than 20 million subs",
        'content': """© Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images A union for TV workers says Apple claimed its TV Plus streaming service had fewer than 20 million subscribers as of July 1st Apple told the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) that its Apple TV Plus streaming platform had fewer than 20 million subscribers, which allowed it to pay lower rates to IATSE workers than bigger streaming platforms, CNBC reported. Apple has never publicly released subscriber numbers for its streaming network, which launched in November of 2019. But Apple TV Plus has fewer original shows than larger, more established streaming rivals like Netflix, which said in August it had 209 million subscribers. “Workers on certain ‘new media’ streaming projects get paid less, even on productions with budgets that rival or exceed those of traditionally released blockbusters,” according to a press release IATSE posted on Tuesday. The release didn’t mention any streaming platform by name, but a spokesman told CNBC that Apple claimed under 20 million subscribers in the US and Canada as of July 1st. The union is preparing for a possible strike after negotiations with production companies have stalled, saying in the release that “the explosion of streaming combined with the pandemic has elevated and aggravated working conditions, bringing 60,000 behind-the-scenes workers covered by these contracts to a breaking point.” Apple TV Plus has several big-budget shows on its roster, including The Morning Show, which stars Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, and Ted Lasso, its surprise hit comedy about an American coaching an English football club. Ted Lasso had a big showing at the Emmys last week, taking awards for Outstanding Comedy, Lead Actor in a Comedy for star Jason Sudeikis, and supporting acting awards for Brett Goldstein and Hannah Waddingham. The Morning Show reportedly costs Apple $15 million per episode, and many of Ted Lasso’s writers and stars have reportedly negotiated more lucrative contracts for the show’s third season. Apple said in July that it had a net profit of $21.7 billion on $81.43 billion in revenue in its third quarter of 2021. Apple and IATSE didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment from The Verge on Saturday. An Apple spokesperson told CNBC that it pays rates comparable to leading streaming services."""

        'title': "Don't turn up your TV's sharpness control. Instead, turn it down (way down)",
        'content': """© Provided by CNET Geoffrey Morrison/CNET Your TV has a lot of picture settings, like brightness, color and sharpness, and turning them all up might seem like a great idea. Who wants a picture that's dim, colorless and dull, right? In reality, maxing out those adjustments can ruin your picture, making it less accurate and limiting the potential of the best TVs. An image that's too bright or garish is easy to understand, but sharpness takes some explaining. © Sarah Tew Increasing the sharpness control actually adds something called "edge enhancement," which can diminish the fine resolution in the image you're looking at. If sharpness is set to high, you might not be benefiting from all the crisp detail that's possible in that fancy 4K TV. Sometimes the best setting is actually 0, while on most TVs the setting is best in the bottom 20% or so.  Here's more on why you should turn down the sharpness control. Your eyes will thank you.  Read more: Want better TV? Change these 9 TV picture settings today (you'll thank us later) Sharpness means edge enhancement On nearly all TVs, the sharpness control adds something called "edge enhancement." That's exactly what it sounds like. The edges in the image are enhanced, essentially by adding a thin outline or halo to them. This makes them more visible. © Provided by CNET Left: the original image. Right: the edge-enhanced "sharper" version. The "halo effect" is what the sharpness control adds. Geoffrey Morrison/CNET Take a look at the side-by-side images above. The left image is the au naturel version. The right has significant amounts of edge enhancement added. Note the outline around the buildings. While the left image might appear, at first glance, "soft," it actually isn't. The picture below is a close-up of the "sharpened" edge-enhanced version. As you'll see, a sort of white halo appears around distinct edges.  © Provided by CNET Geoffrey Morrison The problem is that the halo shouldn't be there -- and it's replacing what should be. It may not seem like a big deal in this image, but with most content that halo is covering the actual detail. Additionally, it often brings out grainy noise in other parts of the image. See how much cleaner the left image looks compared to the enhanced. Edge enhancement definitely gives the image a certain look: It can provide the appearance of more detail. Most TVs have their sharpness controls turned up in the default picture modes, so we're used to this faux-detail look. While unenhanced images can look soft by comparison, especially at first, they're actually more detailed because they show fine textures in walls, pores on faces and tiny hairs -- all of which can be hidden by too much edge enhancement. What's the best TV setting then? The easiest way to check is to switch your TV to the Movie or Cinema picture preset, and see where the sharpness control is in that mode. Whatever that number is, it's a good place to start.  © Provided by CNET Brett Pearce/CNET Want to fine-tune it? While watching a variety of content, especially 4K if you have a 4K TV, turn the control down from that starting point and see what happens. Does the fine detail disappear? If so, that's too low. Ideally, you'll be able to find the spot that offers the most actual detail and the least additional noise. Don't be surprised if that number is 0.  Some TVs actively soften the image when you turn the sharpness control to zero (or even below 50 in some cases). This might be done to offer a way to decrease the noise in lower-quality sources, but I'd be shocked if it's ever used for that purpose. Just something to keep in mind. If the image suddenly looks blurry, that's definitely too low. There's a sweet spot with any TV, it's just a matter of finding it. A setup disc, like the Spears &amp; Munsil UHD HDR Benchmark, has patterns that will make it easier to find the exact sharpness level for your specific TV. It's possible, though rare, that you have a TV with permanent edge enhancement. Even turning the sharpness control to zero and going through every setting (and picture preset) in your TV, you still may see edge enhancement or other processing. This was more common with older TV sets, though. These days it's fairly rare.  What about other visual controls?  Many TVs and some high-end projectors have processing features separate from the sharpness control. These are usually deeper in the settings menus, or in separate "advanced" sections. Some of these can enhance the apparent detail without adding undue amounts of edge enhancement. Others, of course, do more harm than good.  © Provided by CNET The various steps in Samsung's AI Upscaling process. Samsung Part of this is due to the increase in overall processing power available in mid- and high-end TVs. For instance, Samsung, LG, and Sony have discussed using AI for their upconversion, which is how you get a decent-looking lower-resolution image on a high-resolution television. There's no blanket advice here. If your TV has these resolution/detail enhancement features, try out each in turn to see what they do. Sit close, and see if it's adding noise, edge enhancement, or if it's making the image appear sharper. Purists will likely want to keep these features off, especially with high-quality content like from a 4K Blu-ray, but with some content it might help. Consider what the source is Occasionally, the edge enhancement is in the source. This was common on early DVDs, where edge enhancement was added to make them "pop." If it's in the source, there's nothing you can do about it. It's just something to keep in mind if you're trying out different settings, don't use just one source or program. TV manufacturers love edge enhancement, largely because it makes their TVs seem super detailed when viewed in a store. There are also some sources, generally low-quality video like standard-def TV channels or even VHS tapes, that can benefit from a TV's detail enhancement circuits. These sources are so soft and low-resolution to begin with, that when blown up to the size of today's large televisions they may look better enhanced. Looking sharp? Keep looking If you go to your TV right now and turn the sharpness control all the way down the picture is absolutely going to look soft. Much like with high color temperatures, anyone who isn't used to making fine adjustments to their TV controls has gotten used to a certain "look" to their TV's picture. So at first, even the correct sharpness setting might seem soft, especially if your TV has been in the Vivid or Dynamic picture mode. Try the new, lower sharpness setting for a few days. If you then don't like the look of the un-enhanced image, that's fine. Turn it back up. But I bet when you do the "original" setting will look weird.
